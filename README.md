# Lunar Client Accurate Reach Display

This agent removes the cap of 3.0 reach in the reach display mod included in lunar client. This cap is unnecesarry and even misleading, as on rare occasions a hit can be landed at a slightly larger distance.

## Usage of this mod

This agent can be used easily by using [lunar-client-qt](https://github.com/Youded-byte/lunar-client-qt).
